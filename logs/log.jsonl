Contrary to popular belief, llamas actually originated in North America around 35 million years ago. They migrated to South America during the formation of the isthmus of Panama approximately 3-4 million years ago. However, they were domesticated and became an integral part of Andean cultures much more recently, around 6000 years ago."}
